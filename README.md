# Monty Hall Problem

Our family was watching a thing on TV about the Monty Hall Problem and it
started a bit of an argument. It makes sense to me and my sister but not to my
older brother. Since apparently it's demonstrable using code I figured I'd try
and put it to rest.

This code plays the game show proposed in the problem and prints things out as
they happen. It plays the specified number of games and records whether staying
or switching would have won, then reports results at the end.
