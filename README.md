# Monty Hall Problem

Our family was watching a thing on TV about the Monty Hall Problem and it
started a bit of an argument. It makes sense to me and my sister but not to my
older brother. Since apparently it's demonstrable using code I figured I'd try
and put it to rest.

I'm seeing about 50/50 success rate between switching and not switching our
choice, which is apparently incorrect, so I must have a bug in my code.

I wrote this well past my bedtime so it might be something very silly I
overlooked. Uploading this code so I can ask people what's wrong with it.
